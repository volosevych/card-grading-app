# 🃏 Card Grading App

This is a small project I created to refresh and sharpen my API development skills.  
It's a card grading app that simulates a service for evaluating the condition of collectible cards.

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This app is not a full-fledged production service and **not intended for public or commercial use**.  
It was built for educational and personal learning purposes only.

> **Note:** This is **not a free service**. While the app is functional, it may involve costs related to third-party APIs or services it depends on.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I wanted to practice:

- Designing clean APIs
- Working with asynchronous operations
- Handling user input and card data
- Building a small full-stack app workflow

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** TypeScript / React / Vite
- **Deployment:** Vercel
